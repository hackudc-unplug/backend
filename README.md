# UnPlug Backend

Welcome to the UnPlug backend repository! ⚡️

## Technology at Work

Fueling the UnPlug backend are some of the industry's finest tools:

- **FastAPI**: Acting as the backbone of our system, FastAPI empowers us to swiftly develop RESTful API endpoints, effortlessly handling user requests and serving responses.
- **Poetry**: With Poetry, dependency management becomes a breeze, ensuring our project remains organized and reproducible across environments.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: These stalwarts of data manipulation and analysis lend their expertise, enabling us to dissect and understand electricity consumption patterns with ease.
- **ML Models**: UnPlug integrates state-of-the-art machine learning models for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and predictive analysis. These models, including Doctr for OCR and 'stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b' from StabilityAI for predictive analysis, work tirelessly behind the scenes to extract insights from electricity bills and provide valuable tips for optimization.

## Energize Your Development

Getting started with the UnPlug backend is a simple affair:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local environment.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Utilize Poetry to install project dependencies  `poetry install --no-root`, ensuring a smooth setup process.
  
4. **Fire Up the Server**: With everything in place, run the FastAPI development server `poetry run python localhost.py`, or run `poetry run python serve.py` for a production environment and witness the power of UnPlug come to life.

## Harnessing the Power of UnPlug

- **API Endpoints**: Explore the extensive API documentation or Swagger UI to discover the myriad of endpoints at your disposal, each designed to provide valuable insights into electricity consumption.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the backend with the frontend to unlock the full potential of UnPlug, empowering users to upload bills, visualize consumption data, and receive actionable optimization tips.
